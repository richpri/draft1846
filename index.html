        </p>
        <p>DRAFT1846 is a utility for online 1846 games. 
          This utility mediates the private company draft phase of 1846. 
          It was written to be used with BOARD18 but it should be 
          usable with any Play By Email game.         
        </p>
        <p><b>DRAFT1846 uses 
          email messages to pass control from player to player.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The next page displays a form in to which the names and
          email addresses of the players should be entered. 
          For less than 5 players, it also displays a selection box  
          which should be used to indicate the unused privates. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After you have adjusted the number of players, if necessary, 
          please press the "Start the draft setup" button to continue to 
          the next page. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After providing the information on
          the next page, please press "enter". This will cause 
          DRAFT1846 to validate the entries and create a database 
          table entry for this draft. It will then send an email to each 
          player to verify the entered email addresses. When all players 
          have replied to these emails, the draft will be started.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">
          PLEASE NOTE: The private draft in 1846 occurs in reverse
          player order. But the players should be entered on the form on
          the next page <b>in the same order</b> that they are entered on
          the spreadsheet, that is in the normal game order. DRAFT1846 
          will take care of reversing this order in the draft.
