version 0.2.1 - May 16, 2020 - Status Systems Test
I am part way through the process of separating draft1846Next into two sections.
draft1846Next will no longer handle the price reduction phase of the draft.
draft1846Last will take over when there is only one private left.
* The max card select issue is tested.
* Done email link issue is tested.
